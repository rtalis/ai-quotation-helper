# Quotation analizer for the purchasing sector.

While in the quotation sector, i had to deal with 5-20 quotations with 20 or more items, having to enter each price in a excel sheet to compare the values because each supplier sends an pdf generated in their own system without any particular pattern.

I created this software so you can input a item list in pdf, which can contain a base price and analize it with AI, then send the pdf quotations send by the suppliers.
The data in the pdf will be extracted independent of the way they are formatted and a summary will be presented at the end with the option to export to excel. 

## Getting Started

```bash
